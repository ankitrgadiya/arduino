be programmed to do various different things using **Arduino IDE**. To know

# Tinkercad

**Tinkercad** is a web based 3D designing tool, which also includes Electronics
Lab, which was earlier part of **Autodesk Circuits**. Electronics Lab is a
simulator for experimenting with various circuits including Arduino. It includes
a Code Editor, various components required for making circuits and various tools
which makes it easier to experiment.

This repository contains code and circuits I made using **Tinkercad**
Electornics Lab.
